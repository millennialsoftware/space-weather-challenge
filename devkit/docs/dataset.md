## Challenge Dataset Availability

The public challenge dataset will be available for participants to download and use to train and develop their models during Phase 1 of the competition. The warmup dataset is a portion of the full public dataset and is representative of the formats participants can expect for all provided training data.

The private evaluation dataset contains data from spacecraft and/or time periods that are not represented in the public training data. It will retain the same format as the public dataset and will be used to evaluate the performance of the participants' models for the public leaderboard and final rankings.

### Phase 1 Public Training Dataset

The public challenge dataset is available for participants to download and use to train and develop their models during Phase 1 of the competition. The current version of the public training dataset may be accessed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ilxkfy9yla0z2ea97tfqv/AB9lngJ2yHvf9t5h2oQXaDc?rlkey=iju8q5b1kxol78kbt0b9tcfz3&st=j7f0mcc3&dl=0">here</a> and includes the following files and folders:
* <b>Initial state files</b>: contain samples of a satellite's initial orbital elements, geodetic (ITRF) positional coordinates, and a 5-digit file ID for each I/O pair in the provided training data. Each file name has the format `[first file ID]_to_[last file ID]-initial_states.csv`.
* <b>OMNI2 data folder</b>: Space weather information collected by NASA Space Flight Goddard Center and provided in 60-day segments (one 60-day OMNI2 history file per initial state). Each file name has the format `omni2-[file ID]-[first day]_to_[last day].csv`, where the dates are displayed as `YYYYmmDD`.
* <b>GOES data folder</b>: X-Ray flux information collected by NOAA'S GOES satellites and provided in 60-day segments (one 60-day GOES history file per initial state). Each file name has the format `goes-[file ID]-[first day]_to_[last day].csv`, where the dates are displayed as `YYYYmmDD`. **Note: GOES data is not included in V3.0 of the Phase 1 dataset but will be released in V3.1**
* <b>Thermospheric density data folder</b>: Time series orbit average density values collected by ESA satellites and provided in 3-day segments (one 3-day "forecasted" density file per initial state). Each file name has the format `[spacecraft]-[file ID]-[first day]_to_[last day].csv`, where the spacecraft is indicated by a 6-character designation and dates are displayed as `YYYYmmDD`.

Your objective is to design a model that, given a spacecraft's initial state and 60 days of space weather information directly preceding that state, can predict the next 3 days of atmospheric density values the spacecraft will observe.

That is, your model should take in these inputs: 
* A satellite's initial location, provided in both geodetic coordinates and orbital elements
* Space weather information for the 60 day period preceding the timestamp of the initial satellite location
* X-Ray flux information for the 60 day period preceding the timestamp of the initial satellite location

Your model should then predict the sequence of orbit-averaged atmospheric density values that the spacecraft will observe in the future. This prediction must span a period of 3 days directly following the timestamp of the initial satellite location.  

Some recommendations: 
* We recommend reviewing the data column header descriptions in the [Definitions](https://2025-ai-challenge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html#definitions) section for more details on the contents of the challenge dataset. This includes exploring the column headers and data type descriptions. 
* Be mindful of dataset units and representations!
* You may access additional GOES, OMNI2, CHAMP, GRACE, and SWARM data through NOAA, NASA, and ESA online if you wish to supplement the provided warm-up data while training your algorithms.

### Warmup Dataset 

The <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/nz1j92xpr6eet3fa5mx5i/ADMYs2zfr3dvxJ-FFd5dmM8?rlkey=tem27v1d2raf2nnlcq6cd49ev&st=sty6ggo3&dl=0)">warm-up dataset</a> was released to participants on November 15, 2024. 

Participants should use this subset of the STORM-AI data to become familiar with the phenomenology and formats they will be asked to use during Phase 1 of the competition. The warmup dataset consists of the following files and folders: 
* <b>wu001_to_wu715-initial_states.csv</b>: 715 sets of orbital elements and geodetic position coordinates for ESA's SWARM A satellite
* <b>OMNI2</b>: Space weather information collected by NASA Space Flight Goddard Center and provided in 60-day segments (one 60-day OMNI2 history file per initial SWARM A state)

* <b>Sat_Density</b>: Time series orbit average density values collected by ESA'S SWARM A satellite and provided in 3-day segments (one 3-day "forecasted" density file per initial SWARM A state)

There is a specific bit arrangement for <b>xrsa_flag</b> and <b>xrsb_flag</b> values-- you can find more info on <a href="https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/STORM-AI-devkit-2025/discussions/6">this discussion forum post</a>. Overall, it would be most helpful for you to just think of any data entries with 0.0 flag values as ‘good’ data. Any other value in the flag columns can be considered ‘bad’ or ‘compromised’ data.

## Guidelines

Participants should note that algorithm inputs must be limited to the phenomenology and data formats present in the public training dataset, but utilizing additional phenomenology or data sources for model validation and development is allowed and encouraged. 

Also note that since these datasets are collected from real spacecraft, there may be short gaps in the data due to blackout periods and instrument error. Participants should take this into account when designing their algorithms to ensure successful submissions.
